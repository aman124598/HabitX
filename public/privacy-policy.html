          Habit X ("we", "us", "our") is committed to protecting your privacy.
          This page explains what data we collect, why we collect it, how it is
          used, and how you can manage or request deletion of your data.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Data we collect</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Push notification tokens (Expo/FCM tokens)</strong> —
            collected when you enable push notifications; used to deliver
            notifications and reminders. Tokens are sent to push providers (Expo
            or Firebase Cloud Messaging) and our backend servers.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Account information (email, username)</strong> — provided
            directly by you during registration; used for account authentication
            and management.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Habit and progress data</strong> — your habits, completions,
            streaks, and gamification progress are stored to provide the core
            functionality of the app.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Crash reports and diagnostics</strong> — collected
            automatically to improve app stability and performance.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>How we use and share data</h2>
        <p>
          Push tokens are shared with push providers as needed to deliver
          notifications. Account and habit data is stored on our servers and is
          not sold to third parties. We use analytics data to improve the app
          experience.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Security and retention</h2>
        <p>
          Data transmitted by the app is encrypted in transit (HTTPS/TLS).
          Account data is retained until you request deletion or delete your
          account. Habit and progress data is retained as long as your account
          is active.
        </p>
